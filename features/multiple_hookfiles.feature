Feature: Multiple hook files with a glob

  Background:
    Given I have "dredd-hooks-php" command installed
    And I have "dredd" command installed
    And a file named "server.rb" with:
      """
      require 'sinatra'
      get '/message' do
        "Hello World!\n\n"
      end
      """

    And a file named "apiary.apib" with:
      """
      # My Api
      ## GET /message
      + Response 200 (text/html;charset=utf-8)
          Hello World!
